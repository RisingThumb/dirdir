# RisingThumb's build of dirdir

dirdir is werc's directory management tool.

## Features

This adds a few features to dirdir.

- Ability to edit larger text files
- Ability to edit template files
- Ability to upload files(optionally under a different name)
- Ability to delete a page
- Ability to delete a folder
- Ability to delete a file by name

## Installation and usage
* Git clone this repository into your werc apps folder.
* Enable the app by adding `conf_enable_dirdir` into your `_werc/config` file in any folder you want dirdir enabled in.

## Roadmap

- Ideally take some filetype info for making new pages. Would be nice to make tpl files this way.
- User permissioning around editing template files (default config off?)
- Possibly allowing different markdown/formatters to be used.

## LICENSE

In the same style as werc, this repository is dedicated to the public domain. If you require a license because of copyright law, this work is also under the MIT License.
